# Scenario
In this project, I will create Charts and Dashboards in Microsoft Excel using sales data from a sample company. I will use PivotTables to look at discrete trends in the data, which I will then represent as line, bar, and pie charts. Towards the end of the project, I will summarize the sales data creating a dashboard composed of the charts and tables to provide a global picture of the sales data.

# My approach

- I inserted a table so that the data can be sorted and filtered easily.

- I created a new column month to show the month of the order.
